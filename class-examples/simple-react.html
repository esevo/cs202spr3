  <strong>If someone wants to really kick it up a notch</strong>

  <h1>Developing a React App</h1>

  <p>One of the awesome things about tech is it always changing. The instructions you read today are not guaranteed to be valid tomorrow. :) Further, although I think today this is a really good tech stack to learn, tomorrow it will be out-of-date. Always, always review what you know (knew) when building a new app or project!</p>

  <p>Since we are going to use React, we are going to need node and npm. Installing node will get npm. I suggest using NVM (node version manager) but you may already have it installed and there are many other methods. (Note: you can use homebrew on a mac for nvm but it is not officially supported. Please check out the github link above.) Node is one of those things that can be effortless to install -- to a pain in the butt. Part of the experience I guess. Once working though, it is super easy to maintain.</p>

  <p>Some info on node. https://nodejs.org/en</p>

  <p>Install the latest version of LTS node. That stands for long term-term support. It is the stable version, most likely to be well-supported by everything, and you won't have to update it all the time.</p>

  <p>Once you have node installed. Verify it. <pre>node --version</pre> and <pre>npm --version</pre>.</p>

  <p>With node and npm installed you can use npm (node package manager) to install node packages!</p>

  <p>As I have mentioned, React by itself is not a framework although often incorrectly referred to as one. React is just one part of a framework. We are just going to start with React. It will help you understand when you are
  missing needed functionality how this stuff actually works. If you just grabbed a prebuilt set of React frameworks you would not understand. The next time you do a project, use a React framework and it will all make much more sense.</p>
  
  <p>Here is a link to some React Frameworks: https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app</p>

  <p>We are going to use Vite (pronounced veeet, I know) as the build tool. There are others, of course. Webpack used to be THE standard, now it isn't even mentioned in react docs. Vite is the leading build tool today because of its
  speed.</p>

  <p>Here is the command to create app and install ( Read more at
  https://react.dev/learn/build-a-react-app-from-scratch)</p>

  <pre>npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react</pre>

  <p>If needed later, I would suggest using react-router and react-query. Once again read more at https://react.dev/learn/build-a-react-app-from-scratch.</p>

  <p>You will need to build the project likely:<br>
    npm install -> installs/builds project<br>
    npm start -> runs in browser</p>

  <h3>Hopefully all is well!</h3>

  <p>We need to add tailwindcss now. Follow the instructions here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite</p>

  <p>There ya go, Play around see if you can run the app, learn its structure.</p>
  
  <p>package.json will be the installed packages.</p>

  <p>You will need to build it and run it. Use npm to do this. Don't use yarn. It won't gain you anything in this case and most instructions for stuff default to npm.</p>

  <p>Good luck!</p>
